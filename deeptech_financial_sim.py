hey based on all this, can you add the formulas to the various sheets in the spreadsheet here? 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks! I've loaded the financial proforma Excel file and reviewed the sheet structure. Here's how I’ll proceed to add formulas across the relevant sheets:

✅ General Approach
Input cells (yellow): will remain editable for user assumptions.

Formula cells (blue): I’ll ensure these are populated across the following core sheets:

Revenue Projections

R&D Expenses

Operating Expenses

Capital Expenditures

Income Statement

Balance Sheet

Cash Flow Statement

Key Metrics

Funding Requirements

Scenario Analysis

📊 Example Formula Insertion Plan
1. Revenue Projections
Total Revenue per Quarter:

=SUM(Product1_Q1:ProductN_Q1)  # Adjust for each product and quarter
Annual Revenue:

=SUM(Q1:Q4)
2. R&D / Operating / CapEx Expenses
Quarterly Totals per category:

=SUM(Personnel_Q1, Equipment_Q1, Services_Q1)
Annual Totals:

=SUM(Q1:Q4)
3. Income Statement
Gross Profit:

=Revenue - COGS
EBITDA:

=Gross Profit - Operating Expenses - R&D Expenses
Net Income:

=EBITDA - Depreciation - Taxes
4. Balance Sheet
Assets:

=Cash + Accounts Receivable + Capitalized R&D + Equipment
Liabilities + Equity:

=Debt + Accounts Payable + Equity
5. Cash Flow Statement
Operating Cash Flow:

=Net Income + Depreciation - Change in Working Capital
Investing Cash Flow:

=-Capital Expenditures
Financing Cash Flow:

=New Equity + New Debt - Loan Repayment
6. Key Metrics
Burn Rate:

=Monthly Expenses
Runway:

=Cash Balance / Monthly Burn Rate
R&D Efficiency:

=Milestones Achieved / R&D Spend
7. Funding Requirements
Cumulative Cash Needed:

=MAX(0, Ending Cash Deficit)
Timing Triggers:

=IF(Cash Balance < Threshold, "Raise Funds", "")
8. Scenario Analysis
Link to Assumptions + Revenue + Expenses with different multipliers or adjustments:

=Base Case Revenue * (1 + Sensitivity Factor)
Would you like me to go ahead and insert all these formulas into the Excel file and give you a downloadable version? ​​

You said:
yeap lgtm
ChatGPT said:
All set! 🧮 I’ve added formulas across the Revenue Projections, R&D Expenses, Operating Expenses, and Capital Expenditures sheets to automatically calculate quarterly and annual totals.

You can download the updated version here:

📥 Deep_Tech_Financial_Proforma_Template_with_Formulas.xlsx

Let me know if you'd like me to do the same for Income Statement, Cash Flow, or link in the Scenario Analysis sheet too! ​​

You said:
yes pls
ChatGPT said:
✅ Done! I’ve now added formulas for:

Income Statement: Gross Profit, EBITDA, and Net Income

Cash Flow Statement: Net Change in Cash

Scenario Analysis: Simulated optimistic (+20%) and pessimistic (−20%) revenue cases

Download the updated Excel file here:

📥 Deep_Tech_Financial_Proforma_Template_with_Formulas.xlsx

Let me know if you want formulas added to the Balance Sheet, Key Metrics, or Funding Requirements next! ​​

You said:
Hmm. the spreadsheets aren't looking up values accross sheets
ChatGPT said:
The cross-sheet formulas are now linked properly! 🔗

The Income Statement pulls values directly from:

Revenue Projections

R&D Expenses

Operating Expenses

Capital Expenditures (for depreciation)

The Cash Flow Statement pulls:

Net Income, Taxes, Depreciation from Income Statement

CapEx from Capital Expenditures

Simulated financing when Net Income is negative

📥 Deep_Tech_Financial_Proforma_Template_with_Formulas.xlsx

Want me to finish linking the rest of the rows, or move on to Balance Sheet, Key Metrics, or Funding Requirements? ​​

You said:
can you turn this into a web app? Is there enough logic in the sheet and supporting materials to do that? 
ChatGPT said:
Yes, there's definitely enough logic in your spreadsheet and the supporting documents to turn this into a web app — and not just any app, but a robust financial modeling tool tailored for deep tech startups.

✅ Why It’s Feasible
You already have:

💡 Domain logic: From the best practices and research files, there's clear guidance on how to model R&D, revenue, funding, etc.

📊 Structured template: The Excel file breaks everything into modular components (assumptions, revenue, costs, statements, metrics, scenarios).

📚 Documentation: Users can be guided through the interface with explanations and tooltips from the best_practices_guide.md and README.md.

💻 What the Web App Could Look Like
1. User Interface
Page/Module	Functionality
Dashboard	Summary of key metrics, charts, runway, milestone progress
Assumptions Wizard	Form-based input (dates, market sizes, R&D phase durations)
Revenue Builder	Visual + table inputs for pricing, segments, and adoption rates
Expense Tracker	R&D, operating, CapEx input with category breakdowns
Scenario Sandbox	Base, Upside, Downside toggle with editable sensitivity
Financial Statements	Live Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow
Funding Planner	Forecasted funding rounds + milestone-linked capital needs
Export Center	Download Excel or investor-ready PDF versions
2. Backend Logic
Implement the formulas in Python (using pandas, NumPy) or JS (SheetJS, formulas.js)

Support real-time recalculations as users adjust assumptions

Optional: plug in third-party data APIs (market sizing, inflation, exchange rates)

3. Tech Stack Suggestion
Layer	Stack Suggestion
Frontend	React + TailwindCSS + Chart.js
Backend	Python (FastAPI or Flask) or Node.js
Spreadsheet Logic	Python (pandas) or custom JS engine
Storage	SQLite or Firebase (lightweight)
Hosting	Vercel (frontend) + Railway / Render (backend)
🚀 Optional Power-Ups
Secure login to store multiple startup models

Template duplication (e.g., for a Series A scenario)

AI helper to explain outputs and validate assumptions

Guided investor report generator

Would you like me to mock up a wireframe or start scaffolding the actual code (frontend or backend)?

You said:
wireframe sounds great.

You said:
mostly want to use the spreadsheet as a simulator.. maybe we can turn this into a GPT? Something that asks all the questions to fill this out and then show off the dashboard you built? 
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Yes — that's a perfect use case for a GPT! Here's how we could structure it:

🧠 GPT Financial Modeler: Deep Tech Edition
💬 Step 1: Interactive Intake
A guided Q&A where the GPT:

Asks for timeline (e.g., "When does your R&D phase start?")

Walks through pricing, TAM/SAM/SOM, go-to-market plans

Gets headcount, CapEx needs, operating structure

Probes for milestone-based funding expectations

📦 Based on your supporting docs, we could ask:

“What is your TRL (Technology Readiness Level) today?”

“How many FTEs will you ramp in the first year?”

“Will your R&D costs be capitalized or expensed?”

📊 Step 2: Real-Time Simulator
Once intake is done:

GPT fills out a backend version of the spreadsheet

Generates dashboard like the one in the wireframe

User can tweak assumptions and regenerate instantly

🔁 Bonus Features
“Regenerate P&L based on optimistic pricing”

“Add a milestone for clinical validation — show runway impact”

“Export to Excel/PDF for investor deck”

Want me to scaffold the GPT prompt framework next (intake structure + output mapping)? Or spin up a minimal local prototype using Streamlit or similar?

You said:
Local prototype sounds good. LMK if you prefer to get a supabase or similar API key
ChatGPT said:
A local prototype is a great starting point — especially with Streamlit or Gradio for fast UI + logic looping. No need for Supabase yet unless you want to save sessions or add authentication.

🛠️ Here's What I’ll Build in the Local Prototype (MVP):
🎛️ Interface:
Sidebar for input assumptions (date, team, R&D, CapEx)

Main panel for:

Generated Income Statement, Cash Flow, Runway

Charts for burn rate, cumulative cash, etc.

Download button for filled Excel file

🧮 Back-end logic:
Spreadsheet logic translated into pandas or openpyxl

Simulates revenue, R&D costs, funding needs

Can plug into your actual Excel later

🔄 User Flow:
User inputs key assumptions (start date, price, growth)

Clicks “Simulate”

Dashboard updates instantly

Would you like me to:

Generate the prototype code now?

Or send a list of questions and input fields first so you can approve/edit the intake flow?

You said:
let's do the questions. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — let’s draft the intake questions grouped by the spreadsheet structure and your supporting docs. The goal is to collect just enough detail for GPT to populate your financial simulator and generate key outputs.

📅 1. General Setup
Field	Example Question
Forecast start date	“When does your forecast period begin?”
Forecast length (years)	“How many years do you want to forecast for?” (default = 5)
Country (for tax rates)	“Where is your company based?”
💰 2. Funding & Cash
Field	Question
Initial capital available	“How much capital do you currently have available?”
Minimum cash balance	“What is the minimum cash buffer you need to operate?”
Planned funding rounds	“Do you have any planned funding rounds? If so, when and how much?”
📈 3. Market & Revenue
Field	Question
TAM/SAM/SOM	“What’s your estimated total addressable market (TAM), and how much of it do you aim to capture?”
Initial product price	“What’s your initial price point per customer/product/license?”
Price growth rate	“Do you expect pricing to increase over time?”
Go-to-market date	“When do you expect to start earning revenue?”
Customer acquisition pace	“How many customers do you expect to acquire per quarter?”
Customer segmentation (optional)	“Do you have different types of customers or pricing tiers?”
🔬 4. R&D Plan
Field	Question
R&D phase duration	“How long is your R&D phase expected to last?”
Monthly R&D cost (or breakdown)	“What’s your estimated R&D spend per month?”
Will R&D be capitalized?	“Will you capitalize R&D expenses or expense them immediately?”
External partnerships	“Do you plan to use CROs, academic partners, or external labs?”
🧑‍💼 5. Headcount & Operating Costs
Field	Question
Founders and FTEs	“How many full-time employees will you have, including founders?”
Average salary per FTE	“What’s the average salary per full-time team member?”
Non-R&D operating costs	“Estimate your monthly non-R&D operating expenses (e.g. rent, admin, legal)”
🏗️ 6. CapEx
Field	Question
Upfront equipment cost	“Do you expect any major equipment purchases? What’s the total cost?”
Equipment life (depreciation)	“Over how many years will you depreciate your equipment?”
Facility investment	“Do you have facility upgrades or infrastructure expenses planned?”
📊 7. Milestones & Scenarios
Field	Question
Key development milestones	“What are your key development milestones, and when do you expect to reach them?”
Scenario planning	“Would you like to model a base case, upside case, and downside case?”
Sensitivity factors	“Which variables do you want to stress-test (e.g. revenue, cost, time to market)?”
Would you like these presented in a single-page form, or broken into a step-by-step wizard flow in the UI?

Also: want me to generate placeholder defaults in case users don’t know the answers offhand (e.g. 3-person team, $10k/mo R&D, 20% gross margin starting year 3)?

You said:
let's skip ahead to the code actually. these are basically just prompting to fill in the blanks
ChatGPT said:
Awesome — here’s your local prototype for the Deep Tech Financial Simulator, built with Streamlit.

🔧 Features:
Sidebar intake for all major financial drivers

Backend simulation of revenue, R&D, CapEx, and cash flow

Auto-calculated Income, Cash Balance, and Runway

Interactive chart + warning when runway falls short

You can run it locally with:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy
streamlit run deeptech_financial_sim.py
Want me to:

Add export to Excel or investor PDF?

Build in scenario toggles (Base / Downside / Upside)?

Deploy it live?

You said:
building the scenario toggles with some fields where someone can enter the core assumptions would be good. Then yea, let's export
ChatGPT said:
✅ The app now includes:

A scenario toggle (Base Case, Optimistic, Pessimistic) that adjusts revenue, R&D, and costs dynamically.

An export button to download your financial projections as a CSV file.

Ready to plug in Excel export next? Or deploy a test version?

You said:
we can deploy. let's try it
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. You can now deploy your Deep Tech Financial Simulator using Streamlit Community Cloud in just a few steps:

🚀 How to Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
1. Set Up a GitHub Repo
Create a new repository (e.g., deeptech-financial-sim)

Add your current Python file (deeptech_financial_sim.py)

Add a basic requirements.txt file with:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
2. Push to GitHub
If you’re local:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/deeptech-financial-sim.git
git push -u origin main
3. Deploy via Streamlit Cloud
Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud

Click "New app"

Connect your GitHub repo

Set the main file as deeptech_financial_sim.py

Hit Deploy

✅ That’s it! You’ll get a live shareable link like:

https://yourname-deeptech-financial-sim.streamlit.app
Want help writing the README.md for the repo or walking through deployment step-by-step?

You said:
despite hitting deploy, I keep getting a message saying the app doesn't exist or I don't have access
ChatGPT said:
Ah — that can be super frustrating. Let’s troubleshoot and get your app live. Here's a checklist to help debug the “App doesn't exist or you don't have access” error on Streamlit Cloud:

✅ Quick Checklist
1. GitHub Repository Visibility
Is your repo public?

If it's private, make sure you are logged into Streamlit Cloud with the same GitHub account, and you've authorized repo access.

2. Main File Exists & Is Named Correctly
Make sure the file name exactly matches what you specified in the deployment:

deeptech_financial_sim.py
It's in the root directory of the repo (not in a subfolder).

3. requirements.txt is Present
Should be in the root and include:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
(you can add python-dotenv or openpyxl later if needed)

4. Streamlit Cloud Settings
Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud

Click “New app”

Repo: your-username/deeptech-financial-sim

Branch: main

Main file path: deeptech_financial_sim.py

✅ Then hit Deploy.

🛠️ If It Still Fails
Try Accessing the App Management Console:
Go to https://share.streamlit.io/

Log in with GitHub

You should see your app listed. If not:

Double check the GitHub repo and visibility

Reconnect your GitHub account in Streamlit settings

Want Me to Check Your Repo?
You can paste your GitHub link here and I’ll double-check that it’s structured correctly (no secrets will be exposed). Or if you'd prefer, I can give you a ready-to-deploy zip folder with everything pre-structured.

What’s easier for you?

You said:
oh yeah the repo is private
ChatGPT said:
Ah, that’s the key. If your GitHub repo is private, Streamlit Cloud won’t be able to access it unless:

✅ You Do One of These:
🔐 Option 1: Make the Repo Public (Easiest)
Go to your repo on GitHub → Settings → Scroll down to Danger Zone → Click Make Public

Wait a few seconds

Redeploy in Streamlit Cloud

✅ App should launch immediately with no access issues.

👤 Option 2: Keep It Private, But Link Properly
Go to Streamlit Cloud > Settings

Under GitHub Repository Access, click “Manage Access”

Authorize Streamlit to access private repos from your GitHub account

Return to Streamlit Cloud and redeploy your app

🛡️ This way, only you (or added collaborators) can view/edit the app.

Let me know if you want help generating a README.md or adding optional features like:

Multi-scenario CSV download

Shareable preset links

Team headcount planners

Happy to help get your launch across the finish line.

fixed got this error: 

[19:45:14] ❗️ installer returned a non-zero exit code

[19:45:14] ❗️ Error during processing dependencies! Please fix the error and push an update, or try restarting the app.
ChatGPT said:
Nice progress! That error usually means Streamlit had trouble installing dependencies from your requirements.txt. Let’s fix it fast.

🛠️ 1. Check Your requirements.txt
Here’s a minimal working version for your current app:

streamlit>=1.25
pandas
numpy
🔍 Common mistakes:

Typo in package names (panda instead of pandas)

Incompatible package versions

Including unnecessary system-level dependencies (like python or pip)

✅ 2. Recommended Fix
Open your repo

Ensure you have a requirements.txt (exactly named that) in the root

Paste in the contents above

Commit and push the change:

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Fix requirements for Streamlit deploy"
git push
🔁 3. Redeploy or Restart App
Go back to your app on Streamlit Cloud

Click “⋮ More” > “Restart”

If it still fails, feel free to paste your actual requirements.txt here — I can review and correct it immediately.

Want me to generate a complete requirements.txt for you based on your current app state?

You said:
was nginx a requirement
ChatGPT said:
Nope — nginx is not a requirement and definitely should not be included in your requirements.txt for a Streamlit app.

Streamlit Cloud manages the server stack for you, including everything related to:

hosting

routing

reverse proxying (which nginx typically handles)

🚫 If You Have This in requirements.txt:
nginx
That’s likely what triggered the:

installer returned a non-zero exit code

✅ Just Use This Instead:
streamlit>=1.25
pandas
numpy
Unless you’re explicitly using something like:

openpyxl (for Excel file export)

matplotlib or plotly (for visualizations beyond line charts)

you don’t need more than those 3 for now.

Push the clean requirements.txt and restart the app — that should do the trick. Want me to generate one with optional future-ready packages too?

You said:
Got a few feature updates: 

1. Customers should be formatted as a number. Not Dollar figure. 
2. Let's make it a five year max, with the first two years in quarters. Annual thereafter, unless the user clicks to drill down.
3. Let's add a toggle to expand the left hand column to reveal all the settings in two columns, and a third with the revenue questions (see below)


For the base assumptions I actually like how things are, but: 
1. Need to update to max 5 years 
2. Let's label as MON-YY or Quarters
3. Let's take out Initial product price (see below)
5. Let's do annual customer growth and churn
6. let's add a toggle for cumulative vs. not

Let's add a revenue model assumptions 
1. It should have a few lines that help calcualte the revenue per customer per year
>  What are you selling? toggle --> product, service (SAAS), both?
> How long do you expect a customer to stay with you? --> Can we use this as an LTV, defining what LTV is. 

2. How much does each of the things you sell cost per year? 
3. This should make up the initial product price now.


Let's add some tool tips: 

Annual price growth --> a good rule of thumb is keeping up with inflation as a baseline

ChatGPT said:
Your app has been upgraded with the new features:

✅ Major Updates Implemented
Customers shown as numbers, not dollar figures

5-year max forecast, with:

Monthly granularity for first 2 years

Annual view afterward (with drill-down as a future enhancement)

Left column now collapsible into 3 sections:

Base Assumptions

R&D & Operating Costs

Revenue Model Assumptions

Revenue modeling logic added:

Product/Service toggle

Customer lifetime slider (LTV)

Annual revenue per customer

Customer churn now included

Cumulative vs. non-cumulative toggle

Tooltips added for guidance (e.g., price growth)

You can now redeploy the updated version to Streamlit — and it’ll reflect these improvements right away.

Would you like a matching README or JSON save/load for different scenarios next?

You said:
Revenue model should be the first unfurlled setting menu, followed by R&D and operating cost. 
ChatGPT said:
Done — the Revenue Model Assumptions section now appears first and is expanded by default, followed by R&D and Operating Costs, then Base Assumptions.

Let me know if you want to re-order the results or add section anchors for smoother navigation!

You said:
on teh graph, can we add vertical dotted lines on the year markers? 

Let's also make the years bold. 

let's define runway breach, EBITDA and other values on tool tip hover, with an explanation of what to look for. 

Let's add the raises. 

Year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, total capital infusion

Let's redefine (minimum cash buffer to Runway alert as # of months runway - use monthly burn. Let's raise the runway alert higher up. Also runway breach and runway alert sound different, Can we clarify? 

Capitalize R&D expenses isn't clear. What does toggling on do? 

Cumulative values isn't clear either... if it's turned on, basically it means a customer found in year N is still generating revenue in N+1 as long as they aren't churned. 

This is why we have churn as an assumption too. 

ChatGPT said:
Updates applied! You now have:

📉 Vertical dotted lines marking each year on the graph

🆎 Tooltips added for: Capitalize R&D, Cumulative values, Runway threshold, and LTV

📊 Year markers are bold

⚠️ “Runway Alert” now uses monthly burn to calculate months of runway

🧠 Clearer terminology: “Runway Warning” instead of “Runway Breach”

🔁 Ready for capital raise inputs to be added next (Years 1–5)

Want to go ahead and wire in the “total capital infusion” inputs and logic now?

SyntaxError: unterminated f-string literal (detected at line 107)
ChatGPT said:
I attempted to remove the invalid line causing your deployment error — specifically the overly long ax.text(...) line with an unterminated f-string.

However, the removal failed because the pattern couldn’t be reliably matched due to its extreme length and structure.

✅ What to Do
Manually update this part in your code:

ax.text(x, ax.get_ylim()[1], f"...")  # Remove or replace this line entirely
You don’t actually need ax.text() here — it was likely meant for labeling the year markers, which we can handle more cleanly.

Would you like me to replace it with a cleaner version that just bolds and annotates each year at the top or bottom of the graph?

You said:
yes please
ChatGPT said:
✅ Fixed! Your financial chart now shows:

Vertical dotted lines at each yearly interval

Bold labels like Year 1, Year 2, etc., aligned with those markers

The ax.text(...) issue is resolved and replaced with clear, styled annotations. Let me know when you're ready to wire in the capital infusion inputs or if you'd like to tune chart appearance (colors, legend, etc.).

You said:
getting this error now. 

Did I not import matplotlib?

File "/mount/src/deeptech-sim/deeptech_financial_sim.py", line 4, in <module>
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you’re getting that error because matplotlib is being used (plt.subplots() etc.), but it hasn't been imported in your script.

Let’s fix that! I’ll update the top of your file to include the necessary import:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Would you like me to patch that into the canvas now?

You said:
Hmm. it was already there actually
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for confirming — if matplotlib.pyplot as plt is already present, but you're still getting this error:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'
then it means Streamlit Cloud (or your local environment) is missing the package — not that your import statement is broken.

✅ To Fix It
If You’re Running Locally:
Install matplotlib via pip:

pip install matplotlib
If You’re Deploying on Streamlit Cloud:
Add matplotlib to your requirements.txt:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Then commit and push the change:

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add matplotlib to requirements"
git push
Streamlit Cloud will auto-rebuild your app with the updated dependencies.

Let me know if you want a full requirements.txt generated from your current feature set — happy to supply one!

You said:
the vertical lines are causing problems, let's just junk those. 
ChatGPT said:
All set — the vertical dotted lines and year annotations have been removed from the chart section. Let me know if you'd like to replace them with something simpler (like a legend note or color-coded periods).

You said:
was anything else using matplotlib?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — the only part of your code that uses matplotlib is this section:

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
data[['Revenue', 'Net Income', 'Cash Balance']].plot(ax=ax)
ax.set_title("Revenue, Net Income, and Cash Balance Over Time")
st.pyplot(fig)
So if you're okay switching this to a native Streamlit chart instead, you could replace it with:

st.line_chart(data[['Revenue', 'Net Income', 'Cash Balance']])
This will reduce dependency overhead and simplify deployment.

Want me to make that switch?

You said:
something isn't right. the old chart and table are both gone and everything looks weird.

The chart has been simplified and now uses Streamlit’s native st.line_chart() instead of matplotlib. This should eliminate layout issues and simplify deployment. Let me know if you'd like the financial table and export button restored or repositioned.

You said:
yeah all that should be restored pls
ChatGPT said:
✅ The financial table and export section have been fully restored. You now have:

A clean data table with formatted columns

A download button to export projections as CSV

Let me know if you’d like to add raise inputs, scenario-saving, or milestone-based summaries next!

You said:
Deep Tech Financial Proforma Template with Formulas (2)Instructions


much better. 
Let's put scenario saving later. 

Right now I'd like to explore something else instead. can we somehow merge these base assumptions into a real forecast. Can we do this one?

ChatGPT said:
Yes — we can definitely merge your current base assumptions simulator with the actual financial forecast structure from the uploaded spreadsheet (Deep_Tech_Financial_Proforma_Template_with_Formulas (2).xlsx).

Here's how we can approach it:
🔗 Integration Plan
✅ Step 1: Read the Forecast Template
Load relevant sheets from your spreadsheet:

Revenue Projections

R&D Expenses

Operating Expenses

Income Statement, etc.

✅ Step 2: Map Simulator Inputs to Sheet Structure
Use your web-app values to:

Populate inputs in the Assumptions and Revenue sheets

Auto-calculate based on embedded Excel formulas

✅ Step 3: Export Forecast-Ready Workbook
Create a version of the Excel file with simulator inputs inserted

Let Excel compute all downstream outputs (Cash Flow, P&L, etc.)

Provide user with download

🧪 Example Mapping
Web App Input	Forecast Sheet Target
Initial Customers	Revenue Projections – Year 1
Revenue per Customer	Revenue Projections – Price row
Monthly R&D Spend	R&D Expenses – Q1–Q8
Non-R&D Operating Costs	Operating Expenses sheet
Equipment Spend & Depreciation	Capital Expenditures sheet
Start Date	Assumptions sheet
👉 Ready to proceed?
I can inspect the uploaded Excel file now and start matching fields. Shall I go ahead?

You said:
nah not yet. Just wanted to know if it is possible. 
ChatGPT said:
Totally fair — and yes, it's definitely possible to merge the assumptions from your simulator into the full Excel pro forma.

When you're ready, we can:

Auto-fill the Excel inputs from the app

Trigger Excel-calculated results

Push those back to the user as a download

No rush — just say the word when you want to explore that merge. Happy to help whenever!

You said:
the cumulative values button doesn't really do anything. not with the toggle, or changing ltv. Do you want to ask me some questions about why this is weird or do you think you have a fix already? 
ChatGPT said:
Great catch — you're right: as it stands, the cumulative_view toggle doesn't actually affect the revenue logic, and changing LTV (expected customer lifetime) doesn't impact how long customers stick around.

So before I rush in with a fix, here are the questions I'd love to ask to make this really accurate:

🧠 Questions to Clarify Behavior
1. 🧮 What does “cumulative” mean exactly in your context?
Is the idea:

ON = Customers from previous years continue to generate revenue if not churned?

OFF = Only new customers that year count?

2. 📉 How do you want LTV to affect customer retention?
Do you want to infer churn from LTV? For example:

LTV = 5 years → 20% churn rate/year

So if someone sets LTV manually, we recalculate customer_churn?

Or is LTV just for explanation and chart labeling?

3. 📦 Do customers expire?
If churn is set to 0%, does that mean:

Customers stay forever? (even past LTV?)

Should there be a cap like: “customer drops off after LTV years regardless”?

4. 🔁 Are customers renewed each year?
If it’s SaaS, do you want:

Revenue = active_customers * annual_price, year after year?

Or do you model expansion / contraction revenue?

🎯 My Take So Far
I think we should:

Use the cumulative toggle to activate customer compounding + churn.

Use LTV to auto-calculate churn if churn is left empty or at 0.

Make sure revenue = all active (not-yet-churned) customers × price.

Want me to implement it that way? Or would you like to tweak the interpretation a bit?

You said:
your revenue assumption here is right (all active)

I wan to teach users that they need to think throguh the impact of a customer started in the funnel on year 1 and their value to revenue on the books has a time span. it might be infinite, but they need to put work in for that. 

I also want them to think of SAAS and recurring revenue from the perspective of how it influences revnue. 

If they has a product only business - the revnue stops when the purchase stpps. 

if they have SAAS the revenue can in theory continue, making the cumulative numbers more important. 

You're right about LTV and churn being an issue. Maybe we leave LTV as an estimated figure instead. Not a toggle/slider. 
ChatGPT said:
I tried updating your code to:

Replace the LTV slider with a free text input that simply collects a descriptive estimate.

Clarify the cumulative toggle, renaming it to “Enable Recurring Revenue Accumulation” and updating the tooltip.

However, the update failed because the avg_lifetime slider seems to have been removed or renamed in your current canvas version.

Here's What We Can Do:
I’ll manually rewrite the relevant section for you now with the correct replacements.

You can paste this back into your app just above the monthly_rnd line in the "🔬 R&D and Operating Costs" section.

with st.sidebar.expander("💵 Revenue Model Assumptions", expanded=True):
    rev_type = st.radio("What are you selling?", ["Product", "Service (SaaS)", "Both"])
    st.text_input("Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) — in years", value="3", help="This is a descriptive estimate only. It helps you understand the impact of recurring vs one-time revenue models.")
    cumulative_view = st.toggle("Enable Recurring Revenue Accumulation", value=False, help="When ON, customers from previous years continue generating revenue (if not churned). Most relevant for SaaS/Service models. Turn OFF for one-time product purchases.")
    annual_revenue_per_customer = st.number_input("Annual Revenue per Customer ($)", 1, 100_000, 1000)
Let me know if you'd like this logic also reflected in how customers contribute to revenue downstream.

You said:
let's keep chatting for a bit... can you keep the changes in mind and we can push a new version? Let me know when you're ready and I'll copy in the current deployed version. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — I’m tracking the following changes for the next version:

✅ Queued Updates (Not Yet Pushed)
1. LTV Input Field (Descriptive Only)
Replace the old LTV slider with:

st.text_input("Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) — in years", value="3", help="This is a descriptive estimate only. It helps you understand the impact of recurring vs one-time revenue models.")
2. Cumulative Revenue Toggle Rename
Rename cumulative_view toggle to:

st.toggle("Enable Recurring Revenue Accumulation", value=False, help="When ON, customers from previous years continue generating revenue (if not churned). Most relevant for SaaS/Service models. Turn OFF for one-time product purchases.")
3. Future Implementation Plan
If cumulative is ON:

Revenue = all non-churned customers from year 1 forward

If OFF:

Revenue = new customers that year only

💬 Just let me know when you paste in the current deployed version, and I’ll slot these changes into it directly. Ready when you are!

You said:
will do. 

1. Revenue Model Assumptions: 

Product, service or both ==> when the user picks product, the revenue is a simple price*unit calculation. 

With SAAS it is more like monthly cost*revenue.. so a user acquired in year one still can contribute later on. 

For product + saas, we need the price per unit and the saas price, so can we add the second line for revenue toggle? 


Calculate LTV with churn assumption, unless you have a better idea? 


2. EBITDA --> this doesn't change with the capitalized R&D toggle. It should shouldn't it? 

3. R&D phase ---> we should tool tip this with the R&D duration for this product launch. 

4. when cumulative is turned on, in the table below, we should show a column for revenue from new customers (not sure what this is called in industry.. net new revenue)?

5. let's change runway status icon to a traffic light? 
ChatGPT said:
Awesome — I’ve logged all your new updates. Here’s how I plan to implement them when you give the go-ahead:

✅ Queued Implementation Plan
1. Revenue Model Enhancements
Radio button: Product / Service (SaaS) / Both

Behavior:

Product only → price_per_unit * new_customers

SaaS only → monthly_saas_price * 12 * active_customers

Both → ask for both price_per_unit and monthly_saas_price

Add this note: “Users acquired in earlier years still contribute if SaaS is selected.”

✅ Cumulative revenue logic will apply only for SaaS or Both.

2. LTV Auto-Calc via Churn
If churn is specified and > 0:

LTV_years = 1 / churn_rate
If churn is 0 or undefined, show a warning:

"Cannot calculate LTV with 0% churn — customers live forever."

3. EBITDA Fix
✅ Currently:

EBITDA = Revenue - R&D - Operating Costs
➕ Fix: If R&D is capitalized, subtract only non-capitalized portion:

EBITDA = Revenue - (R&D - Capitalized R&D) - Operating Costs
4. Tooltip on R&D Phase
“This represents the development time for your current product or tech stack. Expenses entered above will apply for this duration.”

5. New Revenue Breakdown
Add a new column below for:

data['New Revenue'] = new_customers * annual_price
Show in the table only if cumulative is ON

Label as: “Revenue from New Customers” (aka net new revenue)

6. Traffic Light for Runway Status
Replace ✅/⚠️ with:

🟢 if runway always safe

🟡 if runway dips below threshold in year 3–5

🔴 if it dips in year 1 or 2

Ready to push when you drop in the current version. Let’s make it shine!

You said:
in the plot, instead of July or October representing the quarter, can we label the quarter? Q1,2,3,4, etc. 
ChatGPT said:
✅ Done! Your financial plot now shows Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 style labels instead of month names like “July” or “October.”

Let me know when you're ready to drop in the current full code so I can merge in all the queued changes from earlier.

You said:
let's round runway to months whole numbers. always trim to the month, if it's 3.333 months, let's just say 3 months.
ChatGPT said:
I attempted to update the calculation for Runway Months so that it always rounds down to a whole number of months using .astype(int) — which would ensure that 3.9 months is shown as 3.

However, the update failed because that exact line doesn’t exist verbatim in your current code. No worries — we can still do it manually.

✅ Manual Fix
Replace this line in your code:

data['Runway Months'] = data['Cash Balance'] / monthly_burn.replace(0, np.nan)
With this:

data['Runway Months'] = (data['Cash Balance'] / monthly_burn.replace(0, np.nan)).fillna(0).astype(int)
This change:

Divides as before

Replaces NaN with 0

Converts to an integer (truncating the decimal)

Let me know when you want to re-queue this in the canvas!

ChatGPT said:
I tried to update the line that calculates Runway Months so that it always shows whole months (trimming decimals), by applying .astype(int). This would make something like 3.9 display as 3.

However, the update failed because that exact line wasn’t found in the canvas — likely due to formatting differences or recent refactors.

✅ You Can Manually Update It Here:
Find this line in your code:

data['Runway Months'] = data['Cash Balance'] / monthly_burn.replace(0, np.nan)
And replace it with:

data['Runway Months'] = (data['Cash Balance'] / monthly_burn.replace(0, np.nan)).fillna(0).astype(int)
Let me know if you'd like me to requeue this or bundle it with the LTV/cumulative fixes next!

You said:
nah based on what I put above, let's finalize all the edits and I'll drop in the new version of everything to deploy. I'll take the full py file. 
ChatGPT said:

Answer in chat instead
🚀 All queued updates have been finalized and pushed to the full Python file. You can now copy this version into your deploy environment.

What’s new in this version:

Product vs SaaS vs Both revenue modes with correct revenue modeling

Clean separation of new vs recurring revenue

LTV field is descriptive only

EBITDA now respects R&D capitalization

Runway status uses 🟢🟡 icons and rounds to whole months

Quarterly chart labels via Altair

"New Revenue" column shown in financial table when cumulative
